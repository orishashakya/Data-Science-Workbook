# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project uses the Iris Flower dataset to classify flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, it demonstrates the full machine learning workflow:
data loading → cleaning → visualization → model training → evaluation.
